# 📟 PocketDex

**PocketDex** is a high-performance Pokémon encyclopedia inspired by the classic retro "GameBoy" aesthetic. Powered by the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), it provides a deep-dive into the Pokémon universe with a focus on data accuracy and "Pixel Perfect" visual fidelity.

## 🎨 Design Vision: "Pixel Perfection"
*   **Retro Aesthetic:** Hand-crafted checkered backgrounds and transparent cards with 2dp black borders.
*   **Sharp Rendering:** 1:1 square proportions and "Nearest Neighbor" scaling for crisp, pixelated sprites.
*   **Interactive UI:** Modern Material 3 Hero Carousel implementation for evolution chains, featuring center-aligned pill-shaped previews and smooth morphing transitions.
*   **Edge-to-Edge:** A fully immersive experience where the interface bleeds to the screen boundaries.

## 🛠️ The Core Engine
*   **Data Source:** Built using the extensive PokéAPI database.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Repository Pattern with intelligent in-memory caching.
*   **Sequential Fetching:** Enrichment pipeline that loads Pokémon details, species flavor text, and evolution chains in a synchronized flow.
*   **Navigation 3:** Robust navigation state management that persists across device rotations and configuration changes.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Pokeball Hub & Beyond
The project is evolving toward a unique 5-tab hub system:
*   **The Bag:** A dedicated encyclopedia for items and berries.
*   **Move-Dex:** A searchable library of attacks and abilities.
*   **The Pokeball (Center):** A large, custom Hero button docked in a "cradle" cutout for primary navigation.
*   **Strategy:** A retro-styled type effectiveness chart.
*   **Options:** Trainer profile, data management, and visual settings.

### 🔮 Future Features
*   **Granular Entry Animations:** Staggered "pop-in" effects for card elements synced with Coil image loading.
*   **Game Version Switcher:** Support for switching flavor text between different classic game versions.
*   **Sound Engine:** 8-bit blips and bloops for UI interactions.

*Developed with a focus on performance, data integrity, and retro soul.*
